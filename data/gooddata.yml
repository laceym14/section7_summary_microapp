Description: The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) records data associated with
    section 7 consultation process under the US Endangered Species Actrequests in the
    Public Consultation Tracking System (PCTS) database.  This dataset contains all consultation records
    for which determination data (Jeopardy, No Jeopardy, Adverse Modificaiton, etc.) recorded in
    PCTS was cross-checked with determinations recorded in associated biological opinions.
